# Brain_tumor_segmentation
BraTS has always been focusing on the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. BraTS 2019 utilizes multi-institutional pre-operative MRI scans and focuses on the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous (in appearance, shape, and histology) brain tumors, namely gliomas. Furthemore, to pinpoint the clinical relevance of this segmentation task, BraTSâ€™19 also focuses on the prediction of patient overall survival, via integrative analyses of radiomic features and machine learning algorithms. Finally, BraTS'19 intends to experimentally evaluate the uncertainty in tumor segmentations.
